# Meals_App
 
This is an app coded in dart with implementation in flutter. It consits of a recipe book in which you can add recipes, with photos, time of elaboration, complexity, cost and category. Moreover, you can select favorite meals and filter meals by vegan, vegetarian, lactose free and gluten free tags. 

The objective of this app is to implement providers in flutter. In this case I've used the river_pod flutter package to manage the new recipes, favorite meals, filter recipies with tags and manage the categories when creating a new recipe. In the app we can also see animations and dynamic widgets like the timer or the favorite start. I invite you to see the video and images provided in the "media" folder where I show the app.

I've tries to add as many comments as possible to make the app as clear as possible. But please is you have any question on any part please feel free to ask me.

Have a great day!
